### Recommender systems using matrix factorization algorithms

This project is devoted to the use of matrix factorization algorithms for recommender systems such as SVD, SVDpp, and NMF. Matrix factorization allows effectively solving the task of recommendations, by decomposing the matrix of ratings into the product of smaller matrices that represent users and items.

The **Surprise** library is used for implementation. It provides tools to load data, implement recommendation algorithms, and determine the best parameters via GridSearchCV.
